# Human Protein Atlas - Single Cell Classification

There are billions of humans on this earth, and each of us is made up of trillions of cells. 
Just like every individual is unique, even genetically identical twins, scientists observe differences between 
the genetically identical cells in our bodies.

Differences in the location of proteins can give rise to such cellular heterogeneity. Proteins play essential roles
in virtually all cellular processes. Often, many different proteins come together at a specific location 
to perform a task, and the exact outcome of this task depends on which proteins are present. 
As you can imagine, different subcellular distributions of one protein can give rise to great functional heterogeneity between cells.
Finding such differences, and figuring out how and why they occur, is important for understanding how cells 
function, how diseases develop, and ultimately how to develop better treatments for those diseases.
