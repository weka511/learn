From \cite{blei2017variational}
\begin{align*}
	ELBO(m,s^2,\phi) = \sum_{k=1}^{K}& \Expectation \big[ \log {p(\mu_k);m_k,s_k^2}\big]\\
	+& \sum_{k=1}^{K}\bigg(\Expectation\big[\log{p(c_i);\phi_i}\big] + \Expectation\big[\log{p(x_i\mid c_i,\mu);\phi_i,m,s^2}\big]\bigg)\\
	-& \sum_{k=1}^K\Expectation\big[\log{q(c_i;\phi_i)}\big] - \sum_{k=1}^K\Expectation \big[\log{q(\mu_k;m_k,s^2_k)}\big] \numberthis \label{eq:ELBO}
